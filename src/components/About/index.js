          I am a full stack web developer seeking further opportunity to provide top-quality services to clients and to be a valuable team-player. <br></br>
          Currently a Government Benefit Specialist and Program Coordinator for San Mateo County Health, with 10+ yearsâ€™ experience in a healthcare setting, a master's degree in Public Health from University of San Francisco, and a Full-Stack Coding Certification from UC Berkeley Coding Bootcamp where I developed expertise in front- and back-end web development, database management, and design architecture, such as:<br></br> <br></br>
<li> <i> Front-End</i>: HTML5, CSS, JavaScript (JSON), jQuery, Bootstrap, AJAX, React (Hooks), Progressive Web Applications (PWA), Responsive Design, RESTful APIs, Webpack</li>
<li> <i>Back-End</i>: MERN Stack (MongoDB/Mongoose ODM, Express, ReactJS, Node.js), SQL/Sequelize ORM, GraphQL, User Authentication, Handlebars, Model-View-Controller (MVC), Test-Development Driven (TDD), Version Control (Git)</li> <br></br>
My diverse background in local government and non-profits help me to leverage a range of experiences: being a government benefit specialist and program coordinator enhanced my ability to adapt and problem-solve, my role as a social work assistant and intake coordinator honed my excellent organization and cross-functional collaboration skills, and my educator experience developed my ability to educate others in step-by-step processes. These, in addition to my reliable work ethic, drive for excellence, and passion for unlimited growth, are assets I am excited to bring into my career in web development.
