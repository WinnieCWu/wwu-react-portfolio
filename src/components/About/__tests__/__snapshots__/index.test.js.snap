        Hi everyone! My name is Winnie Wu, and I am a soon-to-be UC Berkeley Extension Coding Bootcamp graduate starting 6/1/2022! I really look forward to applying my newfound coding and development skills in the field, helping the world become a better place for all. Prior to coding, I have been in both the healthcare and education sector, with a focus on preventative work so individuals can be equipped with resources and knowledge to excel and live a healthy lifestyle. I hope to integrate my interests in both tech and preventative work!
